                    be batched. This is to reduce the overhead of the literal
                    command. If they aren't batched, the size taken by the over
                    heads exceeds the size of the data, which is only one byte.
                    The literal command takes one byte, the length will take a byte
                    followed by the byte. Thats 2 bytes of overhead per one byte of
                    literal data. This leads to wastage.
